### About
Lung-MAP is an unprecedented public-private collaboration among: the National Cancer Institute, NCI’s National Clinical Trials Network, SWOG Cancer Research, Friends of Cancer Research, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, several pharmaceutical companies (Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Genentech, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and AstraZeneca’s global biologics R&D arm, MedImmune), Foundation Medicine and several lung cancer advocacy organizations.

### Contribute
How are we contributing? At present, we're working on building machine learning pipelines that will:  

1. Segment and Annotate Lung Anatomy Images
2. Predict the age at which an image was taken
3. Provide a 'future view' of a lung image.
